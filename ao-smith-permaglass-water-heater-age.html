Our Promax Plus water heater suddenly stopped working a few days ago so we ran to lowes and purchased a universal thermocouple. </p><p>When we took out the old thermocouple I noticed that it had a TCO while the universal one did not, no big deal i thought so i installed the new universal thermocouple and the pilot fired right up, literally. </p><p>This was yesterday. Well for the rest of the day the heater stayed on, again literally, but i figured it was normal since it was a new thermocouple. Fast forward to today and the furnace was still turned on. Turned on like when someone is taking a shower or is using hot water. Now i know this isnt normal and very dangerous so we turned off the heater and turned the gas to off. </p><p>So to summarize the heater stayed on after we replaced the thermocouple with a universal one with no TCO. Could the lack of a TCO in the new thermocouple have caused this or is it something else?</p><h4>Reply: TCO Temperature Cut-Off thermal reset switch on an A.O. Smith Water Heater. </h4><p>Below is A.O. Smith corporation's description of their thermal cutoff sensor on the thermocouple: </p><p><em>COMBUSTION CHAMBER TEMPERATURE SENSOR - The C3 Technology water heaters will come equipped with a thermal cutoff (TCO) device that is integral with the thermocouple. Temperature cutoff points range from 160°C to 200°C depending on model. The TCO is an automatic reset thermal switch.</em></p><p><em> When activated it will open the thermocouple circuit and shut off the main and pilot burner gas flow. The pilot would have to be relit after the TCO has had sufficient time to cool down (sensor is below 120 degrees F). </em></p><p><em>The TCO performs two primary functions: </em></p><p><em>• In the event of flammable vapor ignition inside the combustion chamber, it senses the corresponding increase in temperature and shuts off gas flow to the main and pilot burners. </em></p><p><em>• If excessive temperatures inside the combustion chamber indicate poor combustion due to a clogged LDO screen or inadequate air for combustion, the TCO will shut off gas flow to the main and pilot burners. </em></p><p>John, from the above you'll see that the absence of a TCO on a thermocouple would not be likely to force a burner to stay on. I think more-likely the thermocouple you installed is defective or is not properly installed. I've found, for example, occasional operating problems when the end of the thermocouple that screws into the gas valve is not properly seated. </p><p>Watchout: The situation you describe is unsafe. I would leave the heater off pending proper repair.</p><p><strong>Reader follow-up:</strong></p><p>I really appreciate your response. The heater has been off since yesterday and wont be turned on again until the problem is fixed. The installation itself was actually something that I was going to double check. </p><p>Someone suggested the thermostat be replaced, is a faulty thermostat a possibility? This seems unlikely since it was working fine before.</p><h4>Reply: details of the TCO on an AOS water heater</h4><img src='https://waterheaters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/replace-ao-smith-water-heater.png' alt='Ao smith water heater age' title='Ao smith water heater age' /><p>(Apr 10, 2018) (mod) said:<br /> John </p><p>When a gas fired water heater burner won't turn OFF indeed I suspect a bad temperature sensor or thermostatic control. That's because the thermocouple has a more narrowly-defined job: confirming that there is a proper gas flame. The thermocouple is intended to shut OFF the burner IF there is no gas flame - so as to avoid continuing to pour explosive gas, un-ignited, into the building. </p><p>It's a safety device focused on proper gas ignition. </p><p>If your burner has GOT proper ignition and is burning on continuously, AND if no hot water is being taken out of the tank, it'd make sense to look for a bad thermostatic control. </p><p>What's troubling of course is that I inferred from your question that previously the heater was not turning ON and you had no hot water. </p><p>Below is a photo of AO Smith's 160 deg TCO. </p><img src='https://www.building-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AMERICAN-Date-of-Manufacture-_-Serial-Number-Style-1.jpg' alt='Age' title='Age' /><p>Also see this AO SMITH GAS &amp; ELECTRIC WATER HEATER SERVICE MANUAL [PDF] at inspectapedia.com/plumbing/AO-Smith-Gas-Electric-Water-Heater-Service-Manual.pdf retrieved 2018/04/10, original source: AO Smith www.hotwater.com/lit/training/320991-000.pdf</p><h3>Reader Comments &amp; Q&amp;A</h3><p>On 2020-09-15 - by (mod) - </p><p>James<br />SEARS KENMORE WATER HEATER AGE &amp; MANUALS should be more accurate than a mere guess of Aug 1997 - see<br />https://inspectapedia.com/plumbing/Sears-Kenmore-Water-Heater-Age-Manuals.php<br /></p><p>On 2020-09-15 by james Bique</p><p>Have a Kenmore Power Miser 6 Model 220.394100 serial# S 0897C11602 what is the year of manufacturing?<br /></p><p>On 2020-09-01 by ted friedberg</p><p>what is age of my ao smith water heater Model ELJ40 S# AEB308165-Z99<br /></p><p>On 2020-08-31 by Maureen</p><p>How old is my water heater?

Here is an excerpt:<br />It is apparent that for no-flow standby loss reduction, the use of a clock-timer is marginal at best~ A more appropriate test sequence would be one which represents a typical household water use pattern, allowing the tank to be de-energized prior to the final hot water use during the day. Under idealized conditions, the upper limit of savings achievable with a clock-timer would be to reduce standby losses to zero for the duration of the u'off' time by completely using the last tankful of heated water. <br />A more realistic limit would be to use the last tankful down to about 100degF which would reduce the temperature differential to about 30 degrees over ambient the off period.<br />Calvin W. Ek, P.E. and Co Douglas Auburg, PeE., CEM, ELECTRIC WATER HEATER STANDBY LOSSES: COMPARISON OF CONSERVATION STRATEGIES AND THEIR ENERGY SAVINGS, Bonneville Power Administration (un-dated), retrieved 2018/12/25, original source: aceee.org/files/proceedings/1984/data/papers/SS84_Panel5_Paper_06.pdf<br />You can find a copy of this paper at InspectApedia.com at<br />inspectapedia.com/plumbing/Water-Heater-Standby-Loss-Elk.pdf<br />Other interesting facts about standby losses of water heaters:<br />Gas water heaters have higher standby losses than electric water heaters as additional heat from the water tank is lost through the exhaust flue (an automagic flue damper can reduce that loss)<br />Larger water heater tanks, because of their larger surface area, tend to have higher standby losses.<br />Tankless water heaters that do not maintain any reservoir of hot water have zero standby losses. <br /></p><p>On 2018-12-25 by EG</p><p>I have older model AO Smith electric water heater in this apartment I moved into.
