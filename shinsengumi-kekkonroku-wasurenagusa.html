How is she doing?</p><p>Is it a cold after all? Maybe she’s been pushing herself too hard recently. It seems like she’s taking a long time to recover from her cold.</p><p>It’s not a cold? Then what is it?</p><p>A different illness?</p><p>Huh? What’s that mean?</p><p>Well… She’ll get better soon though, right? Tell me if there’s anything I can do. I can look after her.</p><p>[00:54]<br />No… She won’t get better? What are you talking about?</p><p>Hey! What are you talking about? She won’t get better… In other words…</p><p>Wait! Hey!</p><p>It can’t be… It’s just not right…</p><p>I’m coming in, Little Bird.</p><p>[01:54]<br />Ah. You look well. How are you feeling?</p><h2>Shinsengumi Mokuhiroku Wasurenagusa</h2><p>Eh?</p><p>Ah. It was a just cold after all.</p><p>Jeez! You were probably cleaning the garden in the cold again, weren’t you?</p><p>Well, you’ll get better if you rest, so just keep doing that for a while. You’ll take a few days’ break from working as a maid too. When you hadn’t started working here yet, the men took turns doing the laundry and cooking. It’ll be fine for a little while.</p><p>Ah. Your cough is quite bad.</p><p>It’s okay. I’ll take care of you.</p><p>[02:50]<br />I have missions to deal with though. Now I’m going out on patrol again. I’ll stay with you all the time when I get back. Be good and wait for me. Alright?</p><p>Yes. That’s good!</p><p>Eh? I’m going to catch your cold? I don’t care about that!</p><p>If I’ve got time, on my way home, I’ll buy the bean paste wafers we had the other day. So don’t even think about sneaking out of bed to do some work. Got it?</p><p>Alright. See you later.</p><p>[04:10]<br />Damn it!</p><p>That day, I became sure that neither God nor Buddha existed in this world. If the fear of losing her had come to me suddenly, then my decision to protect her was also sudden. I suppose that’s how you can start to love someone. In that case, it’s taken me quite a long time to get to this point. If only I had noticed you sooner.</p><p>[05:07]<br />Hey, Little Bird. Why am I such a fool? If only I could go back to that moment, with the same feelings I have now. If I could, then perhaps I could have kept you living in a cage until the very end.</p><p><strong>Track 2</strong></p><p>Hey! What are you doing out of bed? You’re not better yet, so you have to rest, don’t you? Come on, get back in bed.</p><p>Right… From tomorrow, I’ll be leaving the headquarters for a little while. I’m going to fight in Toba [1]. Some time ago, Yoshinobu-kou [2] brought about the restoration of imperial rule, and control went over to the imperial side, didn’t it? Recently, the decree for the restoration of imperial rule was sent out too, wasn’t it? But it seems that the Choshu and Satsuma [3] won’t be satisfied unless the shogunate is overthrown.</p><p>[01:02]<br />So we Shinsengumi are going to follow Yoshinobu-kou to Osaka.</p><p>It’s alright, there’ll be 150 men going. We won’t lose that easily. Anyway, I told you this before, didn’t I? I’m confident that I won’t lose to anyone when it comes to sword fighting. I’m definitely going to return home alive.</p><p>Why do you look so worried? Could it be that you don’t believe me?</p><p>[01:59]<br />There’s no way I’d leave you behind and die somewhere else, is there? You should concentrate on getting better before I’m back. I’ll bring you a gift and I’ll tell you all the interesting stories from my time in Osaka. So make sure you get well and wait for me. Got it?</p><p>Alright, that’s a promise!</p><p>Okay, let’s make it a pinky promise.</p><p>Alright. Get some rest now. I’ll stay by your side until you fall asleep.</p><p>Goodnight, Little Bird.</p><p>[03:25]<br />And so, we Shinsengumi made our way towards Toba. Unlike our expectations, the battle did not go as planned and many of the Shinsengumi were killed. As I brought down my sword, I suddenly questioned the reason I was staying with the Shinsengumi.</p><p>Eventually, in accordance with Hijikata-san’s orders, we hurried to Osaka Castle. But the commander Yoshinobu-kou was not there. He had already escaped to Edo. We had no choice but to follow him to Edo, but during the journey, the Shinsengumi became greatly divided.</p><p>[04:25]<br />At that time, two months had already passed since I left the headquarters. When I hold onto my sword, your face comes to mind. I wonder how I can make you happy?</p><p>Hey, you probably know about your illness by now, don’t you? You know that I lied to you, don’t you?</p><p>The battle at Edo ended in complete defeat too. I did the best that I could. I don’t have any regrets about the troop.</p><p>[05:18]<br />I’m going to protect you. I’m going to find my own place too. I wonder if you’ll be angry at me for doing something selfish. But this is all I can do now.</p><p>Little Bird!</p><p>I’m home.</p><p>Sorry I’m late. The battle took longer than I thought it would.</p><p>[06:24]<br />I’m glad that you’re well.</p><p>I’m exaggerating? Of course I’m not. I’ve been worried all this time.</p><p>Yes, we lost the battle. Hijikata-san, Kondo-san and the others won’t be coming back to the headquarters yet. I’ve got to go again soon too.</p><p>Hey, I’ve got something important to tell you. Will you listen?</p><p>I’ve decided to leave the Shinsengumi. I’m going to create the Seiheitai [4] with Sano. We plan on heading to Aizu and continuing the battle separately from the Shinsengumi.</p><p>[07:20]<br />But I think we’ll be staying in Edo for some time, then gradually heading towards Aizu.</p><p>So… If you don’t have a reason to stay here, then I’d like you to come with me. I think I’ll be able to win any battle if you’re with me. I definitely won’t put you in danger. I promise. So… What do you think?</p><img src='https://mikorin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hiyokuroku7.jpg' alt='Wasurenagusa' title='Wasurenagusa' /><p>[08:12]<br />I see. I’m glad. You’re still feeling unwell, aren’t you? I’ll do all the chores until you feel better, so you concentrate on getting better.</p><p>You dummy. Why are you crying? I didn’t mean to make you cry.</p><p>You’re happy? I see.</p><p>I’m going to protect you, Little Bird. So I want you to let me stay by your side.</p><p>[09:09]<br />I’m going to try my best. I’m going to try my best so that you can keep smiling.</p><p>We’re going to leave soon. I’d like to leave tomorrow, if possible.</p><p>Ah, don’t worry about your health. I’ll think of an easy way to get there. Pack up your things, alright? Make sure you have a proper rest too. Okay?</p><p>You look so happy.</p><p>Right, you haven’t been outside much lately.</p><p>[10:00]<br />Ah, shall we go for a walk once we get to Aizu? Depending on where we’re staying, I might be able to show you the sea too.</p><p>You haven’t seen the sea, have you? Let’s look at it together.</p><p>I’m going to pack up my things too. See you later.</p><p>[1] Toba – An area which was an important port between Osaka and Edo (Tokyo) during the Meiji era (1603-1868).<br />[2] Yoshinobu-kou – The last shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate. He unsuccessfully tried to reform the shogunate.<br />[3] Choshu and Satsuma – Two powerful clans which were attempting to overthrow the shogunate.<br />[4] Seiheitai – A unit formed by Sanosuke, Shinpachi and a group of former shogunate retainers to fight against the Imperial Army.

I thought you’d be tired from the long journey.</p><p>You must be happy that you’ve been able to go out. We’re still a long way from Edo though. We’ll be staying at several places along the way, like we are now. We’ve got keep our strength up.</p><p>[00:49]<br />Ah, here you go. It’s kintsuba [1].</p><p>Sano gave it to me just now. It seems to be pretty expensive. I’m giving it to you.</p><p>Ah. We were going around a lot of places looking for new members. There was a new sweet shop near the dojo Sano visited today. The shop was giving them out to celebrate its opening.</p><p>Ah, I’m alright. There’s only one anyway.</p><p>Eh? You’ll give me half?</p><p>Thank you. I suppose I’ll take it then.</p><p>[01:48]<br />Ah… It tastes good. That’s just what I’d expect from good quality sweets!</p><p>Did you like it too?</p><p>How about we go and thank Sano together sometime?</p><p>Eh? You want to eat other sweets?</p><p>That shop is a little far from here, so I couldn’t let you walk there.</p><p>If you really want some, I’ll buy them for you, so just wait.</p><p>Eh? You want to go somewhere?</p><p>Hmm… I see.</p><p>Then how about we go for a walk together now?</p><p>There’s a nice lake around here. It’s not that far away, so it should be fine.</p><p>[02:48]<br />Haha. I’ll carry you if you get tired.</p><p>Alright, let’s go then.</p><p>Okay, take my hand. Here we go!</p><p>We’re here. Alright, sit there.</p><p>[03:53]<br />One of the locals told me about this place. You can see the mountains on the other side, can’t you? There’s bright red sunset over there when it gets to dusk.</p><p>We’re here at the right time, so I think we’ll be seeing it soon.</p><p>You’re looking forward to it?</p><p>Right… So am I.</p><p>I wonder if birds often gather here? There are quite a lot of them.</p><p>What’s the matter? You’re spacing out.</p><p>You envy the birds for being able to fly in the sky?</p><p>You want to fly in the sky too, Little Bird?</p><p>[04:53]<br />Come here.</p><p>You can’t do that. It’s no good if you don’t stay by my side.</p><p>Don’t decide to fly away into the sky all by yourself.</p><p>I want you to stay by my side forever.</p><p>Your kisses are always so clumsy.</p><p>But you’re fine that way. You don’t have to know how to kiss.</p><p>[06:01]<br />Hmm? What is it?</p><p>Ah, the sunset.</p><p>Oh. I thought your face had turned red, but it was actually the sun setting.</p><p>It’s bright red and beautiful. If only this time could continue forever.</p><p>For a while, we watched over the blood red sunset as it faded away.</p><p>[07:02]<br />I wonder how much longer I’ll be able to see the beautiful landscape with you.</p><p>I quickly held back the tears which were about to fall.</p><p>The more I look back on the past, the less I understand. When did you end up being this important to me?</p><p>We stayed in that place until the crimson sky had turned dark.</p><p>Hey. What were you thinking as you saw the sun set? That day, I strongly wished that your mind was at peace.</p><p>[1] Kintsuba – A sweet made from bean paste cut into squares and fried in batter.</p><p><strong>Track 4</strong></p><p>Hey, are you awake? You fell asleep while watching the sunset.</p><p>Jeez, you can fall asleep anywhere.</p><h2>Shinsengumi Kekkonroku Wasurenagusa Download</h2><p>It was beautiful though, wasn’t it? I’m glad I got to see it with you.</p><p>What’s the matter? You’re asking for my attention…</p><p>Thank you?</p><p>[00:43]<br />No, I should be the one thanking you. I wouldn’t have thought about going to the lake if it wasn’t for you. I got to see this landscape because of you. Thank you.</p><p>You’re smiling a lot now. When I first saw you at the headquarters, you always looked scared and I thought you were a bad tempered person.</p><p>Hey. Have I been able to keep the promise of making sure you don’t get lonelier?</p><p>I see. I’m relieved then.</p><p>[01:51]<br />You can relax too. I’ll always be by your side from now on, you see.</p><p>You smell nice. I wonder why, it’s not as if you just had a bath. I’m the only one who gets to experience your scent this close, aren’t I?</p><p>You like being kissed, don’t you? You look dazed and you seem comfortable. I like kissing you too.</p><p>[02:55]<br />It’s like we’re melting together. It excites me.</p><p>I want to show you what you look like to me. You close your eyes slightly and concentrate hard.</p><p>Did you know that you hold onto the edge of my kimono when something feels good?</p><p>You didn’t know, did you? I’m sure you don’t hold on tight, so you’re doing it without thinking. But I’m happier about you doing it without thinking.</p><p>[03:50]<br />Do you understand that feeling?</p><p>Come on. Tilt your head.</p><p>Did that hurt?</p><p>What did I do? I left a mark on you.</p><p>Proof that you’re my lover.</p><p>It’s most noticeable on your neck. If I do this, strange men won’t approach you, will they?</p><p>[04:52]<br />As long as you’ve got this mark, I’ll be able to think that you won’t go anywhere. I want to make lots of marks on you.</p><p>Hmm? You’re not interested in other men?</p><p>Haha. I see. You’re right. There’s no man as good as me.</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>Since falling in love with you, I’ve stopped caring about attention from other women. I even think that other women aren’t even necessary in this world.</p><p>[05:54]<br />As long as you stay beside me, that’ll be fine.</p><p>You still don’t believe me? Well, it’s true that I was always playing around until I met you. But you understand just how serious I am about you, don’t you?</p><p>Hey. Shall we take this off? It’s in the way.</p><p>[06:50]<br />Your skin is really pale. When you were at the headquarters, doing laundry and working in the garden, your skin was much darker. I like you the same either way. No matter what you look like on the outside, you’re still you.</p><p>You look cute there.</p><p>Hey, concentrate on here more.</p><p>Why’d you stop me? Are you still feeling unwell?</p><p>You think I’ll catch your illness if we keep going?</p><p>[07:49]<br />You dummy. Isn’t it a bit late to say that? Accepting you and your illness is my intention.</p><p>More… You can stay still. I’ll keep going by myself.</p><p>I want to take a good look at you as you are.</p><p>I think you look thinner than before. It bothered me when I was carrying you back here from the lake. You haven’t been eating much recently because you’ve got no appetite.</p><p>[08:52]<br />You’ve got to make sure to eat well. Right, I’ll make you lots of tasty food tomorrow. We’ll have something special early in the morning to keep your strength up. Then we’ll be able to start making our way to Edo again.</p><p>I’m better at cooking than you’d think.</p><p>You look like you don’t believe me.</p><p>Look forward to tomorrow then. I’ll make you something special to eat.</p><p>Why are you looking away? Are you embarrassed to see my body? You see it a lot when I’m training, don’t you?</p><p>[09:48]<br />It’s not a big deal anymore. Or do I look different from before?</p><p>Of course that’s right. I’m no longer a soldier, I’m just a man who loves you.</p><p>You only belong to me.</p><p>You’re sensitive to being touched here, aren’t you?</p><p>[10:48]<br />If I run my hands along here while kissing you, your eyelashes flutter slightly.</p><p>How about if I lick you here?</p><p>Relax a little.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>Does that feel good?</p><p>The other thing you seem to like is your ears.</p><p>Did that tickle?</p><p>[11:49]<br />You look really cute right now.</p><p>I can tell you’re only thinking about me at this moment.</p><p>It’s gotten hot, hasn’t it? If only we could melt together with our body heat.</p><p>Hey. How are you feeling?</p><p>I’m happy that I can feel you too, right now.</p><p>This sensation tells me about you more than anything.</p><p>I love you, Little Bird. I love you. I’ve never felt this happy before.</p><p>[12:54]<br />I don’t ever want to let go of this time. Kiss me even more.</p><p>You’re going to hold onto me? It makes me happy when you desire me like that. It’s good when you’re forward too. It makes me want to stay like this forever.</p><p>I wonder if it’s proof that you want me.</p><p>[13:59]<br />You’ve got small hands. Aren’t they only half the size of mine?</p><p>Maybe I said too much.</p><p>You don’t like that? It’s alright, isn’t it?</p><p>I want to love you completely. Your hair, your chest, your fingers…</p><p>What is it? You’re too embarrassed to look at me?</p><p>Your face is red.</p><p>[14:52]<br />Hey, did you know this? It turns me on when you look away like that.</p><p>You’re amazing.</p><p>Hey, I want you to tease me even more.</p><p>That’s right. Touch me enough to break me.</p><p>That’s it.</p><p>I know it’s wrong to say this, but sometimes I’m thankful.</p><p>[15:50]<br />I’m glad you were near the Ikedaya that day. If you hadn’t been there, we wouldn’t have even met. It might have been better for you to have not been involved and to be living together happily with your family. But I got to know you instead. I can’t go back to how I was before.</p><p>I’m sorry for being this kind of man. I’m sorry I can’t be the kind of man who would honestly wish for your happiness.</p><p>Eh? You’re happy? You’re happy that you met me?</p><p>[16:52]<br />I see. That’s what you’re telling me.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I love you, Little Bird.</p><p>You’re cute. Why do I love you so much?</p><p>I don’t understand. Why does my heart hurt so much?</p><p>[17:51]<br />Help me, Little Bird.</p><p>Let’s stay together forever from now on.</p><p>I like that look on your face.</p><p>That happy look on your face is the one I like the most.</p><p>Only show it to me from now on.</p><p>Thank you for loving me.</p><p>[18:53]<br />Shall I wipe off your sweat?</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>I’ll go out shopping tomorrow morning. Just as promised, I’ll make you something to get your strength up.</p><p>What would you like to eat? Perhaps it’d be good to buy a local speciality.</p><p>Is there anything else you need? I’ll look for anything you need.</p><p>Huh? You want to draw some pictures?</p><p>Hmm… That’s great.</p><p>[19:51]<br />I’ve got paper and brushes among my things, so I suppose we don’t need to buy them.</p><p>Use them as much as you like. Draw a picture of me too.</p><p>I’m sure you’ll draw something really weird looking. I’m looking forward to seeing it.</p><p>I think I’m done drying you off. Put your arm through the sleeve.</p><p>Alright, there we go.</p><p>I’m going to put the blanket on you.</p><p>Are you cold?</p><p>[20:45]<br />I see. I know there are two beds, but how about we share one tonight?</p><p>Alright, I’m getting in then.</p><p>It really is a bit small. But I suppose that’s alright.</p><p>Come on, come closer to me.</p><p>Good night.</p><p><strong>Track 5</strong></p><p>Ah, it turned out pretty well!</p><p>I’m amazing! I bet Little Bird will be surprised when she finds out I can cook!</p><p>Thanks for letting me borrow the kitchen, landlady.</p><p>Alright, I suppose I’ll go and wake her up.</p><p>Little Bird! It’s morning!</p><p>[00:52]<br />Hey, I’ve made a really tasty breakfast. I’m proud of it! Let’s eat it together!</p><p>Little Bird?</p><p>Come on, wake up. It’s morning.</p><p>Little Bird…?</p><p>I see.</p><p>You did your best until now.</p><p>[01:52]<br />But if only you could have stayed with me a little longer…</p><p>You only just promised that we’d be together forever.</p><p>How does it feel to fly in the sky?</p><p>Can you see me from up there?</p><p>Hey.</p><p>[02:58]<br />I love you, Little Bird.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Damn it! Why? Why?!</p><p>[04:30]<br />Hey, Little Bird. You’re a cruel person, aren’t you?</p><p>If you knew this would happen, then why didn’t you say anything?</p><p>The day I left the inn, I found a letter from you among our belongings. You were lying when you said you wanted to draw, you actually wanted to write down your last feelings. There was a shakily written letter, with only the words “thank you for staying by my side” on it. Beside those words was a badly drawn picture of me.</p><p>[05:30]<br />You appeared unexpectedly and opened up a great hole in my heart when you suddenly flew towards the sky.</p><p>I think of you when I look at the blue sky. Your skin was pale and you smiled an unclouded smile at me.</p><p>I wonder if I was able to protect you until the end. Saying “thank you” to me feels like you were talking in the past. I’m still by your side now.</p><p>[06:28]<br />As long as you’re in my heart, I’ll always be by your side. So there’s no need to feel lonely.</p><img src='https://static.zerochan.net/Shinsengumi.Mokuhiroku.Wasurenagusa.full.1794554.jpg' alt='Wasurenagusa' title='Wasurenagusa' /><p>Hey. Will you watch over me from where you are? I think I’m going to live as a soldier for a little longer, here in Japan. I’ll try to become strong, so that I won’t be ashamed of myself when I’m reunited with you in the skies.</p><p>[07:25]<br />I’ll definitely see you again. I’ll hold my feelings for you deep in my heart and take hold of my sword once more. Amidst this blue sky, I’m going to try and see this chaotic era through until the end. So please wait for me until the day we meet again. You are the person who is most important to me in the world.</p><p><strong>Track 6</strong></p><p>I’m Maeno Tomoaki, the voice of Nagakura Shinpachi. I’ll be using the dummy head mic for the free talk too. The recording has just finished, and I’ve got several questions about my thoughts on the recording itself.</p><p>[00:27]<br />Right… When I first saw the script, it was about 80 pages long. Most of it was filled with Shinpachi’s lines and I thought “what am I going to do about this?” I read the script, prepared to finish it by the end of the day. I was nervous about the length of the recording and thought “can I really record it in that time?”</p><p>[01:08]<br />Well… The recording was somehow completed in four hours, without any trouble. I was reminded that dummy head mics have their own, unique difficulties.</p><p>Alright, next question.</p><p>[01:28]<br />What scene left the greatest impression when you played Nagakura Shinpachi? Mention any scene you would particularly like the listeners to hear.</p><p>In this romantic story with a strong storyline, it’s difficult for me to think of just one scene. I’d like it if everyone who listened had their own opinion and felt “this is the scene I like most” about a particular scene.</p><p>I used the dummy head mic quite a lot, so I feel like those parts are particularly worth listening to. I’d be glad if you were satisfied with those. When I hear the whole thing I’d like to give my own thoughts on it too.</p><p>[02:31]<br />Were there any similarities between you and Shinpachi?</p><p>Similarities, huh… I guess that we both like girls?</p><p>Hmm… I’m not that good at sword fighting and I’m not as handsome either. I might not be able to find other similarities.</p><p>Ah! But I can cook. I’m not sure whether I’d say I’m talented though. We might be similar because I do a little cooking.</p><p>[03:08]<br />Do you have a favourite member of the Shinsengumi?</p><p>Since I grew up with Rurouni Kenshin [1], Saito Hajime left the greatest impression on me and is the one I feel most familiar with. But I quite like the Shinsengumi in general and I’ve appeared at events wearing the Shinsengumi happi coat [2]. I also own a happi. I like the Shinsengumi, so I’m really happy to appear in this work.</p><p>[04:05]<br />Could you say something about the character you played?</p><p>I’d hope that you’re listening to this free talk after hearing the main story. I tried to imagine the feeling of losing the person I love the most when I did the recording, but I don’t have a personal experience of something like that, so my performance may have been limited by my imagination. I tried to adjust myself to that.</p><p>In the end, Shinpachi overcomes the death of the person he loves the most and does what he needs to. I think he must be a strong person for him to say something like “please wait for me until then”, so I’d like him to be happy.</p><p>[05:12]<br />How did you feel about using the dummy head mic?</p><p>Right… Dummy head mics really…make your back hurt. That’s how I felt. There are some scenes where you have to bend down and it makes your back hurt when you’ve got to stay in that position. From now on, I think I’ll be appearing in more projects that use a dummy head mic, so I’m going to increase my experience of that.</p><p>[05:57]<br />Last of all, please give a message to everyone listening.</p><p>Right… I know this series is a very popular one. I’ve joined the series in this second season and I came to the recording studio with a sense of responsibility towards building upon the first series. If there is a chance, I’d like to take my responsibility further and play Nagakura Shinpachi again. I hope you’ll continue to support this series.</p><p>Thank you very much. I’m sorry if some parts were too provocative to listen to.</p><p>This was Maeno Tomoaki, the voice of Nagakura Shinpachi.</p><p>[1] Rurouni Kenshin – A series set during the early Meiji era (1868-1912), about the life of a former assassin of the shogunate.<br />[2] Happi coat – A straight sleeved jacket often worn at festivals.</p><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p><strong>mikorin.wordpress.com</strong></p></p>
