Someone who will dedicate his time and energy for 60 days, following the schedule and then, in parallel to how we review workouts, write the most extensive Insanity Max 30 review on the net.</p><p>After some back and forth with couple of people from the fitness industry, we decided to approach Sandra, a close friend of ours who we know was going to be up to the task. She already completed two weeks of the program, and is now going to spill the beans. This page is going to be updated regularly, so we can monitor her entire journey.</p><p><strong>Sandra, the rest is yours…</strong></p><p>Quick intro before I start this Insanity Max 30 review… I was on the fitness wagon for as long as I can remember; Gym workouts, Zumba, cardio feats, Aerobic, even competing in the girls Fitness category… the whole nine yards, really.</p><p>The thing was, after a while of getting in and out of routine, I took a D-tour and allowed weight to pile up some. The passion for competing has returned, but this time it was nearly impossible to restart the same fitness routine I previously subscribed to. Slightly overweight and not knowing how to burn fat tissue that fast, I needed something else.</p><img src='https://blogs.sapo.pt/cloud/thumb/6606a178bcbd75d38f74d3675a9448e2/aplpa/2019/insanitymax30.png?size=xl' alt='Insanity Max 30 Download Utorrent' title='Insanity Max 30 Download Utorrent' /><p>Being familiar with the Insanity workout from a couple of years back, I knew this was going to be brutal and effective. The question was how much. When the guys from Lifestyle Updated approached me, I figured why not go with this new update of Insanity and see how things are going to work out. After all, it’s only 30 minutes a day we are talking about here.</p><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MceisuF4AK8/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Insanity max 30 download torrents' title='Insanity max 30 download torrents' /><h2>What is Insanity Max: 30?</h2><p>Insanity Max: 30 is a 60 day fitness program created by Shaun T, divided into two months of different sets of workouts, each lasting for 30 minutes.</p><p>The Max: 30 workout is not a short version of the original Insanity workout. With new concepts of training, new moves and modifications, it is something else entirely.</p><p>The workouts abandon the max interval training method, and introduce the concept of maxing out- going as hard as you can for as long as you can. The goal is to try and hold your ground as long as you can before- and I quote Shaun T- your lungs feel like sandpaper. Then, you just write down the time, each day moving closer to that 30 minutes mark.</p><p>As their advertising goes, these are the hardest 30 minutes of your day, for the best results of your life.</p><p>Shaun T, the creator of the original Insanity workout, had to change the whole concept of training in order to fit the same results of the original Insanity within just 30 minutes.</p><p>Not until we saw the results for ourselves… Lean, shredded, insanely ripped bodies. You’d think they’d spent the last 60 days doing Insanity, sweating through workouts 45 minutes or longer. But our test groups got these results in just 30 minutes a day.</p><p>Here is how their official Beachbody site describes the workout in short.</p><p>At first, you might only make it through 3 minutes (and believe me, even that will be an accomplishment). That means 3:00 is your MAX OUT time. Next time you do the workout, try to push that time just 30 seconds longer. If you can make 30 seconds of progress every day for 60 days, at the end of 60 days, you will make it all the way to MAX 30. And when that happens—trust me…you’re going to feel—and look—like a freakin’ fitness god.</p><p>You don’t necessarily have to push yourself in order to endure the whole 30 minutes mark, but as far as you are giving in your best, you are golden.</p><span>Get insanity Max 30 and all other Beachbody workouts for just $99</span><h2>Why Insanity Max: 30?</h2><p>There are a couple of reasons why this workout beats others by a huge margin. I will speak for myself now, and hope that this will address some of your questions.</p><ul><li>30 minutes a day for 5 days a week is a lot of convenience if you ask me. Working late shifts, this helps me rather much. Besides, I have weekends free- something that you usually have to trade if you are chasing the results this program is promising.</li><li>Interesting and engaging moves, helping not only with looks but functional fitness as well. I’ve been in the fitness industry for a while, always concerned about how I look. This program offers the chance to increase your physical preparedness tenfold. It’s been two weeks already, and I feel like I never have before- cardio is off the roof, endurance too. Besides, I notice an increase in overall strength, without lifting weights.</li><li>It is challenging. And that’s important for someone like me. Even before I accepted the offer to write this review, I knew quite well that this was going to be a personal challenge. The hardest one I’ve faced in my entire relationship with fitness. The great thing about Insanity Max: 30, is that you have zero chances of completing a workout back to back. Say what you will about your shape and preparedness, but it is physically impossible. I’m progressing from the first day when my max out time was 7 minutes, and wait to see if Shaun T really keeps his promise of getting me through the entire workout.</li><li>You don’t need any equipment at all. And this is also convenient if you have a history of working out in a gym. It allows you to focus your strength on what is really important- completing the sets- and not stressing about changing machines, weights, or whatnot. This, unquestionably, results with more progress.</li><li>There are modifications to each move. Very important if you are not up to the game. It is probably not embarrassing to mention that I did the modifications for a couple of times, since these workouts are brutal. Using the modifications though, everyone can push according to their own level of fitness.</li><li>Shaun T will be there for you, motivating you and making you push harder and harder each day.</li><li>Because it works, and works wonders. It’s been two weeks now, and I’ve lost almost 7 pounds. Muscles are getting shredded, and my abs are showing like crazy. Another great thing is the fact that there are so many small muscle groups popping up around that I never, in my entire fitness background, knew existed.</li></ul><p>Also, if you already bought this workout, you can now stream it with the new Beachbody On Demand streaming service, read more in this Beachbody on Demand review. You can find all kinds of Beachbody workout programs inside, like the Piyo workout (read more in this Piyo review).</p><h2>Why not Insanity Max: 30?</h2><p>Before agreeing to write this Insanity Max: 30 review, I was specifically told not to write “flowery prose only”. Keeping true to my promise, here is why you might want to stay away from this workout altogether.</p><ul><li>If you are someone who is constantly looking for excuses, go ahead and close this tab – albeit having modifications to each move, Max: 30 is the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Buckets of sweat, muscles sore and trembling after each workout. You can gradually step into it by following the modifications and taking more frequent breaks, but you will have to dig deep at one point or another.</li><li>You will have to eat clean for otherwise results would be subpar. Not following a rocket science, but eating a healthy and balanced diet. I started following the nutrition guide that comes included in the package, but figured out ways around it too. As long as you are eating clean and healthy, there is no need to limit yourself to anything.</li><li>There are no weights included, so forget about insanely bulking up. You will have dramatically improved muscle definition though, making your muscles appear bigger.</li><li>If you are having some knee or back injuries, or some problems with the ankles, I hate to spoil the fun, but you will have to see a doctor first. I’ve been told of some people with knee injuries who did the original Insanity workout, and somehow managed to pass through the 60 day period, so having modifiers, Max: 30 would probably fare better in this regard. Anyway, go and see a doctor first.</li><li>Figuring I haven’t stressed it enough, here it is again- this is hard people. Hard, hard, hard.</li></ul><h2>What to expect?</h2><img src='https://www.tenforums.com/attachments/performance-maintenance/30125d1485954121t-high-memory-usage-when-using-utorrent-2015-08-09_21-21-42.jpg' alt='Insanity max 30 download utorrent' title='Insanity max 30 download utorrent' /><p>Much of this has been covered above, but let us be clear about expectations again. Paying close attention to their marketing, and playing around with the program myself for a while, here is my take:</p><ul><li>Somewhere around 20 pounds to lose</li><li>Dramatically improved muscle definition</li><li>Abs- for sure</li><li>Decent amount of muscle gain (this depends heavily on the level of intensity you invest, as well as the amount of protein you consume)</li><li>Cardio, endurance, agility, strength, speed… all improved tenfold.</li><li>A lot of fun</li><li>A lot of sweat and pain</li><li>The most bitter-sweet period of your life bar none.</li></ul><p>I guess you would love for me to go in more detail, but any way I try to spin it, these are the logical expectations after seeing what this program can do in as little as two weeks.</p><h2>Insanity Max: 30 review – The workouts</h2><p>Shaun T says this is the hardest workout he ever taught- and I couldn’t agree more. Day 1, I nearly fainted after writing down my max out time. Few days back, I decided to push harder and nearly puked (Took away some valuable lessons about eating before a workout).</p><p>The 12 workouts are divided into two months, focusing on cardio, Tabata strength training and then some brutal testing of your body and mind.</p><p>Month one is easier (funny how writing this word feels when describing the workouts I’m currently doing) than month two, but still hard as hell. As you progress, you can handle increased intensity, that will overwhelm you in month two- note that I still haven’t started month two, but judging from what I do now, and what I’ve seen in the remaining six videos… oh boy. I already feel proud of myself for taking this challenge. What comforts me some is the fact that I only have to keep it together for 30 minutes. And that’s the mantra I’m using.</p><h3>Cardio challenge</h3><p>This workout welcomes you into the program with what can easily be described as baptism under fire. Routines that are not so much resistance oriented per se, but require cardio endurance, leaving you out of breath quickly, dripping buckets of sweat.</p><h3>Sweat intervals</h3><p>High intensity interval training, stressing your body as early as within the first couple of minutes; this is where you burn a tremendous amount of calories. The sequences are very engaging, targeting your entire body, while activating your core throughout the entire workout.</p><h3>Tabata power</h3><p>Very challenging resistance moves, where you are using your own body weight in order to supply the resistance- Tabata style intervals consisting of 20 seconds all-in, and 10 seconds of cooling down; at this stage, you are targeting your muscles mercilessly, and thinking about quitting the program altogether.</p><h3>Tabata strength</h3><p>Unlike traditional strength training routines where you pump weights for a couple of seconds and then take rest for equally as long, here you are doing the length of the workout without taking any rest at all. The moves are even more demanding, and quite innovative when compared to other programs by Beachbody.</p><h3>Friday Fight: Round 1</h3><p>I had to cool down for about 10 minutes after finishing the first time. It was brutal. Not going to spoil the surprise, I’m keeping quiet for this one. By the time you finish with this workout though, your body will change in terms of how it looked before you pressed the play button. Yup, I’m serious.</p><p>I still haven’t tried the workouts from month two, and plan on going according to schedule. Here is a list of the workouts though, and how Shaun T and Beachbody describe them:</p><h3>Max out cardio</h3><p>This may be the craziest cardio workout you’ve ever tried. Just wait till you get to the first power move…</p><img src='https://simplesmentedannyblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/calendar.jpeg' alt='Insanity Max 30 Download Utorrent' title='Insanity Max 30 Download Utorrent' /><h3>Max out sweat</h3><p>The more minutes you make it through, the more you sweat and the more calories you burn.</p><h3>Max out power</h3><p>The intervals are longer in this “45 seconds on, 15 seconds off” Tabata style plyometric power madness.</p><p><em>(From what I see, your legs are going to cry for mercy).</em></p><h3>Max out strength</h3><p>Your arms, shoulders, chest and core will be toast after this upper-body-focused “45 seconds on, 15 seconds off, Tabata style routine.</p><p>(A lot of core work indeed… though judging from what I see, I think that here is where you get those defined and strong shoulders).</p><h3>Friday Fight: Round 2</h3><p>The new “hardest workout ever”.</p><img src='https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/4GHBxtpw-_k/hqdefault.jpg' alt='Insanity max 30 download free utorrent' title='Insanity max 30 download free utorrent' /><p>You also get two extra workouts included- <strong>Pulse</strong>, and <strong>Ab attack: 10</strong>. The first is more of a stretch and recovery routine, whereas the second is targeting the abs, making you change between a C-sit position and a plan position repeatedly.</p><span>Get insanity Max 30 and all other Beachbody workouts for just $99</span><h2>What’s included in the package?</h2><ul><li>You will get 12 workouts, plus the additional two</li><li>The Nutrition to the Max guide – I’ve read the guide, and it is not going too much into complicated detail and regimen of nutrition.</li><li>Max out wall calendar, and max out wall tracker – You will know what workout to do each day and simply follow the calendar. Also, you can write your max out time each day.</li><li>Max out guide – The program explained, and tips on how to maximize your results. Now this is mostly common sense, and some explanation of why these methods of training- Nothing especially useful here.</li><li>No time to cook guide – An interesting little guide about how to make smart choices even if you are not willing to invest the time; I can already see some people benefit already.</li><li>24/7 online support from Beachbody coaches and peers, access to the forum, and all the questions you want to ask</li><li>A Max out T-shirt once you finish the program and send them a picture</li><li>30 day money-back guarantee less the shipping</li></ul><h2>My results with Insanity Max 30 so far</h2><p>Before starting with Max: 30, I wanted to set my expectations straight. Though the goal was to actually lose weight only, and somewhat improve my cardio endurance, I’m surprised of the results already.</p><ul><li>So far I’ve lost 7 pounds, and started to see real change in the way my whole body looks.</li><li>My cardio and muscle endurance are already more than I hoped for, and it continues to improve.</li><li>So far, most of the body fat I’ve lost is around the abdomen, waist and thighs.</li><li>I can definitely see more muscle definition, and my abs are showing like crazy.</li></ul><p>And this is halfway into the program. I’m pretty confident that by the end of the 60 days, the results are going to be amazing. Cannot wait, actually.</p><h2>Tips for better results with the Insanity Max 30</h2><p>Most of the Insanity Max: 30 reviews out there are describing things to the extent of what is included in this program. What I’ve found from personal experience though, is that there is need for more guidance on how to make sure you follow through with the workouts.</p><p>Here are a couple of tips that helped me push forward so far.</p><ul><li>Make sure to approach the workout of the day with the following attitude- you are going to have fun, test your limits and be OK with whatever comes out of those 30 minutes. Never be disappointed if you cannot match what you did yesterday. The body knows to be tired and fatigued sometimes, so there is no reason feeling bad about it. The more you stress over the workouts, the less effective they become.</li><li>Whenever you think about stopping and taking a break, know this- just two more reps-. nothing more, just two. This will make a tremendous difference in terms of your progress.</li><li>Try to have a good night’s sleep. I’m not going to preach about seven or eight hours, and certainly not devise a sleeping schedule- your body knows best, so make sure to allow yourself a proper rest.</li><li>Eat clean, eat smaller portions throughout the day, and follow as much as you can when it comes to principles of healthy eating. Also, make sure to never eat less than one hour prior to a workout. Really, take this lesson from me, and don’t try to learn it on your own.</li><li>Always prepare before a workout. A towel, pair of sneakers (don’t be crazy and go barefoot), water bottle, pen and paper close nearby… The more you prepare, the less stressed you will be when you push the play button. Save the energy for the workouts, and approach each one with calm and smile- might sound naïve, and borderline silly, but it helps a lot.</li><li>Listen to your body- you go out of breath- stop. Muscles hurt like crazy for two or three days in a row- take a day off. Following the schedule is important, and much advised- but we are all different and our bodies know best how much we can take.</li><li>In addition, skipping a day, though not recommended, is really not that big of a deal. You have 60 of them so don’t worry if, for whatever reason, you’ve missed one. Oh, and this- never ever try to repeat the workout you skipped yesterday, by adding it as a second workout the day that follows. These routines are brutal, and unless you reach a more comfortable position where you can do them with ease (say around the end of month two), never try such feats.</li><li>Most people new to fitness aren’t familiar with the extent of their true physical potential and capability. Learning these takes time, so make sure to dig deep enough- assume that you can do more, and try. You will be surprised, believe me.</li></ul><h2>Where to buy the Insanity Max 30?</h2><h3 id='insanity-max-30-download-utorrent'>Insanity Max 30 Download Utorrent</h3><p>*Update – All Beachbody workouts, as of recently, are sold through their subscription model titled <em>Beachbody on Demand</em>.

That being said, I also hope I didn’t bore you to death. Whether the Max 30 is worth your time and money, I cannot say for sure.
