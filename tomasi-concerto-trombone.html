The first number stands for <b>Flute</b>, the second for <b>Oboe</b>, the third for <b>Clarinet</b>, the fourth for <b>Bassoon</b>, and the fifth (separated from the woodwinds by a dash) is for <b>Horn</b>. Any additional instruments (Piano in this example) are indicated by 'w/' (meaning 'with') or by using a plus sign. </p><h3>Tomasi Trombone Concerto Scribd</h3><img src='https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/document/294704411/original/25172c4586/1602334885?v=1' alt='Tomasi concerto trombone concerto' title='Tomasi concerto trombone concerto' /><center><b>Flute Oboe Clarinet Bassoon — Horn</b></center><p>Sonatine Attique is for solo clarinet and is, reputedly, a 'poetic recollection of a night spent by Henri Tomasi under the Greek sky near the Parthenon in Athens.' (Woodwind.org) It was composed in 1966 and published in 1967 by Alphonse Leduc. Tomasi's output covers some 130 opus numbers including grand opera, song, film music, the mass, the concerto and the symphony. While conducting held centre-stage it did not obliterate his composition activity.
