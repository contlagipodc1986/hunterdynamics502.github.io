There are factors that you need to look for to ensure that you get the quality that you deserve.</p><p>If you are a first-time buyer and don’t want to get ripped off when buying a Bluetooth speaker, here are some tips for you.</p><ul type='disc'><li><strong>Bluetooth connection</strong> – make sure that it is compatible with any device. Look for compatibility with Android, Apple, Kindle, NFC, and even tablets and PCs. Check out the range, too. You should still be able to connect within 33 feet up to 50 feet. You may also want to look for the <span>aptX codec,</span> which provides a high-quality CD-like sound. However, aptX is not compatible with Apple devices. The alternative is the A2DP support.</li><li><strong>Portability</strong> – Keep in mind that smaller is not always better. A very light and small speaker is portable. The downside is the sound quality will suffer. More than 10 lbs is already heavy. Don’t choose a product that is more than 15 lbs.</li><li><strong>Durability </strong>– You may opt for a waterproof speaker if you like having excursions in or near the water. However, if your purpose is to bring the speaker outdoors, you don’t need this feature. Opt for a sturdy-looking speaker instead. Check the frames and materials used if they are thick and not brittle.</li><li><strong>Warranty</strong> – A product warranty is beneficial in case your product gets damaged during shipment. This is not saying that the product is not durable. A warranty is useful for factory defects which may have slipped through quality inspection. It is best to have one for emergencies.</li><li><strong>Audio drivers</strong> – Look for speakers which have at least 4 or 5 audio drivers. Dual-coil subwoofers that measure more than 5 inches are recommended.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Sound</strong> – Surround sound is a great feature. Look at the wattage and choose something that is 200 watts or above for a more powerful sound.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong> – Speaking of portability, how long your Bluetooth speaker plays while it is unplugged is something to look out for. It should be able to run for 10 hours or more. Otherwise, you should be able to charge it in a 110-220v electrical socket. Check also if the battery pack is removable so you can purchase an extra one.<br />Keep in mind that battery life is also affected by the loudness and how frequent you change your music. Bluetooth connections also affect battery life, so you may want to connect your device directly.</li><li><strong>Wired connections</strong> – To save on your portable speaker’s battery life, it is best to choose a speaker that has a 3.5mm audio jack where you can plug in your device. An AUX input jack will also come in handy. Speaking of connections, an added benefit is when you can connect it with another portable Bluetooth speaker of the same type for added power.</li><li><strong>Equalizer </strong>– The Bluetooth speaker needs to have equalizer settings so you can customize it according to the music genre. You should be able to fine-tune them or use the pre-set options manually.</li><li><strong>Budget </strong>– Set a budget for your purchase. How much is too expensive for you? The speakers don’t have to cost an arm and a leg for you to get the best quality. You just have to watch out for the specifications.</li><li><strong>Location</strong> – Think of where you would normally use your portable speakers. The sound quality will differ in a very large room as compared with outdoors. How it sounds inside the store will be very different once you bring it home and play it in the garden.</li></ul><p>All audiophiles who own a mobile device should definitely get a portable Bluetooth speaker. You can bring your music anywhere and play it for the enjoyment of others. You can even use it in your car to enhance the music.</p><p>If you love having outdoor parties, a portable Bluetooth speaker comes in handy. Just make sure that it is not bulky enough to carry around, or else you’ll look like the sound system man.</p><h2>Testing the Speakers</h2><p>The first thing that <span>you should test is the sound</span>. Test it outdoors or in a large room and take note of the quality. Adjust the bass, mids, highs, and pre-set equalizer according to the music genre. Listen to the sound of the bass if it emits a vibrant and booming sound with no skips. Crank up the volume and listen for distortion.</p><p>Try pairing it with different devices and see how easy it is to connect. Time how quick or how long it takes to connect to the speakers and if you get kicked out.</p><p>It is also important to see if the battery life stays true to its claims. Leave the speakers on and set a timer until they turn off. You may want to opt for calming music if you’re going to play it overnight and choose an acceptable volume so as not to disrupt others.</p><p>The<strong> Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth speaker</strong> stays true to its claims of smooth, hassle-free, high-quality sound. When fully charged, it played music for up to 9.5 hours. The sound quality is also excellent no matter what the genre is – rock, R&amp;B, jazz, blues, poop, and even classical music sounded great. The equalizer settings were easy to manipulate.</p><p><br /></p><h3>The Best Bluetooth Speakers</h3><p>The surround sound is also impressive outdoors or indoors. Play it in a garden, in the living room, in a large conference room, or in the beach, and you get fantastic music. It sounded really great inside a room. It fills all corners of the room with its rich bass and trebles.</p><p><br /></p><p>One downside to this product is the LCD which should display important information such as signal, pairing, firmware version that makes troubleshooting easier. The LCD clearly displays the Bluetooth signal and the equalizer settings, which makes it acceptable. Also, in case you should run into some serious problems, a manual is difficult to find. However, customer support is very helpful and easy to contact so you can just give them a call.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are also some rare reviews that iPhone pairing is difficult. The workaround is to reboot both devices to refresh the connection, and you’re good to go.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, the Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth speaker is a good buy. Although it costs almost $300, you can never go wrong as it comes with a product warranty. Also, it is durable enough and looks classy. You can even display it in your living room without ruining the aesthetic look. The sound quality is also excellent, so the price is just right.</p><span>(Last Updated On: August 8, 2020)</span></p>
